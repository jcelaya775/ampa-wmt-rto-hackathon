1. Predict where animals travel and why (i.e. biases towards or away from particular landmarks, directions, time-
of-day constraints, etc; be creative!) - Insert your name here

2. Examine interactions with city systems (i.e. do animals cross highways, potentially creating public 
safety/driving hazards?) - Insert your name here

3. Understand differences between cities (i.e. do cities have different properties which might contribute to 
animal or human behavior and outcomes?) - Insert your name here

4. Understand within-city patterns (i.e. are certain regions of cities more vulnerable to this issue; if so, why?) 

5. Understand properties of animals related to travel (i.e. do animals with microchips or of certain sizes/ages 
travel differently?) - Insert your name here

6. Understand finder scenarios (i.e. do individuals who find animals generally live near the animal? Are there such 
things as “super-finders” who repeatedly find and bring in animals such that they could be trained to return the 
animal directly to home? - Insert your name here
